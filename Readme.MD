An imitation of a game I saw and liked.  
  
You and the opponent have 25 tokens.  
The tokens are arranged in 5 columns.  
Each turn, you choose one column to attack an opponent's column.  
You must you the token at the top of the column.  
  
Their are 5 basic token types of varying strength.  
1 - quantity 5  
2 - quantity 5  
3 - quantity 3  
4 - quantity 3  
5 - quantity 2  
6 - quantity 2  
  
If a stronger token attacks a weaker one, the weaker is removed from the game.  
If a weaker token attacks a stronger one, the weaker is removed from the game.  
If a tokens of equal strength are in combat, it is a draw, and both are removed from the game.  
  
There are three special tokens.  
7 - quantity 2 - super attacker  
Properties:  
When attacked, the super attacker always loses.  
When attacking, the super attacker always wins.  
  
8 - quantity 2 - super defender  
Properties:  
When attacked by anything but the super attacker, it is always a draw.  Both tokens removed.  
When attacked by the super attacker, the super defender really pulls it out and wins.  
If used to attack, always loses but does reveal the opponent token. *variation from the original game*  
  
9 - quantity 1 - king  
Properties:  
Much like in chess, you have to protect your king.  Unlike chess the king cannot deal damage.  
When attacks, it always loses. *variation from the original game to allow surrender*  
When attacked, it always loses.  
When removed from the game that player loses.  
  
Additional rules to be added as multi-player and a GUI(s) are added.  
  
Currently, only 2 player hotseat is available.  It was more as a proof of work/fun thing to get it started.  
  
It's a lot like a simplified Stratego :)  
  
When the GUI(s) is(are) complete, it will contain a skinning engine.  So, you can choose the artwork.  
For now the tokens will remain blank.  

To run the CLI, just clone the repo and import app.
